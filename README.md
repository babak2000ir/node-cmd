# Web Terminal
* node
* react 
* craco
* nodemon plugin

v 1.0.0
This is a POC and dangerous project, when runs on a server gives you a terminal windows ad run your commands on the server, hosting the solution, using node:child_process.

During the project I built a minimalist Node/React framework using webpack, craco.

```Dev``` mode can be started using vscode tasks

```Build``` will create a full stack "dist" folder using PowerShell.


I'll fork it as soon as I tested it in another POC (load balancing in nodejs using node:worker_threads) and made sure it's final.
